<!-- 
    The Brazilian flag has official proportions defined by law, 
but there is no precise specification regarding the size in pixels. 
However, the official proportion of the flag is 7:10 (height:width), 
which means that you can use this proportion to determine the size 
in pixels of the flag according to the desired width.

        var tela = document.querySelector('canvas');
        var pincel = tela.getContext('2d');

        /*Brazilian flag with a width of 500 pixels, 
        you can calculate the height by multiplying the width by 7/10 as:
        500 x 7/10 = 350
        
        Therefore, the image of the Brazilian flag with a width of 500 pixels
        would have a height of 350 pixels. It is important to remember that 
        these dimensions are only a suggestion and that the actual size 
        may vary depending on the image resolution and intended use.
        */

        //rect
        pincel.fillStyle = 'green';
        pincel.fillRect(0, 0, 500, 350);

        /*The diamond on the Brazilian flag has proportions defined by law. 
        According to Brazilian legislation, the diamond must have a width 
        equivalent to 1/2 of the flag's width and a height equivalent to 
        1/2 of the flag's height.
        
        Since the official proportion of the flag is 7:10 (height:width), 
        we can calculate the proportions of the diamond as follows:
        
        -- Width of the diamond: 1/2 x width of the flag = 1/2 x (10 units of measurement) = 5 units of measurement
        -- Height of the diamond: 1/2 x height of the flag = 1/2 x (7 units of measurement) = 3.5 units of measurement
        
        Therefore, the diamond on the Brazilian flag is 5:3.5 (width:height), so if rect width is 500px, 
        the proportion of the diamond would be 250:175 pixels (width:height), 
        */

        //diamond 250 by 175
        pincel.fillStyle = 'yellow';
        pincel.beginPath();
        pincel.moveTo(250, 50);
        pincel.lineTo(50, 175);
        pincel.lineTo(450, 175);
        pincel.fill();
        //bottom triangle
        pincel.beginPath();
        pincel.moveTo(250, 300);
        pincel.lineTo(50, 175);
        pincel.lineTo(450, 175);
        pincel.fill();
