<!-- 
    The Brazilian flag has official proportions defined by law, 
but there is no precise specification regarding the size in pixels. 
However, the official proportion of the flag is 7:10 (height:width), 
which means that you can use this proportion to determine the size 
in pixels of the flag according to the desired width.

    <script>
        var tela = document.querySelector('canvas');
    var pincel = tela.getContext('2d');

        /*Brazilian flag with a width of 500 pixels, 
        you can calculate the height by multiplying the width by 7/10 as:
        500 x 7/10 = 350
        
        Therefore, the image of the Brazilian flag with a width of 500 pixels
        would have a height of 350 pixels. It is important to remember that 
        these dimensions are only a suggestion and that the actual size 
        may vary depending on the image resolution and intended use.

        pincel.fillStyle='green';
    pincel.fillRect(0, 0, 500, 350);
